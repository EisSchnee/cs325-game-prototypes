<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
What is original about your game?
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
What is interesting about your game technology?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype?
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it?
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All the images and sounds I got were from an osu! skin called minimalist that I downloaded a long time ago. Made by a community member called Inori. Link can be found here: https://osu.ppy.sh/community/forums/topics/197917
<ul>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It's a basic bullet hell. I didn't use another games code as a basis for this assignment, however I did use the Game Mechanic Explorer (specifically the lunar lander and walker) for reference.
<ul>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A basic bullet hell where you collect the green circles in order to increase the amount of objects on the screen
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
State which of the Storymatic themes you used.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
arrow keys for input, bullethell genre, random bullet spawns and directions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
movement and collisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Be mildly interested
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Simply use the arrow keys to avoid the blue circles while getting the green circles. Pretty simple. A lot of this project for me was figuring out the hell that is javascript, and since I wasn't using another game as a model, I wrote everything other than what was provided in template-gamestate from scratch. Of course, I used online documentation and resources for reference. 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
quick fingers.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
A The main character was supposed to have multiple states, but in the end the collision system seemed to be proccing rapidly anytime one collision was made. So now, he is small and weak when hit by a blue, and big and excited when he consumes a green.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who are very bored and need to get rid of time
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Unfortunately, I couldn't get my win or lose screen to work, so it doesn't actually end.
