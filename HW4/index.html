<h2>Bouncing Egg</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
You control 4 pong paddles, and attempt to keep the ball from going out of bounds. 
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
The ball gets faster and faster as your score goes up. The score goes up based on a counter that increments everytime update is called, effectively acting as a timer. There are 9 key mappings in total, WASD, Arrow keys, and Shift. They effect different objects.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that, when creating a collision method, position has to be edited directly so sa not to proc the collision again. I learned that for most keys on the keyboard, KeyCode has to be called instead of Keyboard. I found the setup and out of bounds check to be easy, the actual collisions require a little more thought.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The closest game to this would definitely be pong. It same mechanics, just more times and with different goals.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Control the paddles to keep the egg on the screen
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
chicken
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Inputs are: WASD, Arrow keys, and Shift to go faster. The starting direction of the egg is random. There is also a certain amount of percieved randomness in how the egg bounces/speeds up sometimes.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Being able to control multiple objects, having an object increase its speed incrementally, objects colliding and bouncing.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I'd like them to have fun. As the egg gets faster and faster, you may find your attention split among the four sides of the screen. Controlling four objects makes it so the challege comes from splitting your focus.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
W and A control the left paddle (up and down respectively), Arrow UP and Down control the right paddle (same), A and D control the top paddle (left and right respectively), Arrow Left and Right control the bottom paddle (same), and Shift increases the speed at which all paddles move by 2x. The goal of this game is to keep the egg on the screen by blocking its path off screen with the paddles. The longer you go for, the higher your score gets and the faster the egg gets. The game is over when the egg goes off screen.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Determine the next x and y quadrant the egg is going to hit next, and focus your attention on those two paddles. Once the game gets faster, use shift to reach the location fast enough to catch the egg.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play a rare neon chicken who comes to find a regular chicken egg. Since you are a neon chicken, you can't lay eggs of your own, so you want to protect this one. Unfortunately, your also a very bouncy chicken and everytime you touch the egg it bounces off you. Keep it from getting into danger for as long as you can.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
people who are bored and want to kill time
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
depends on how good you are, I suppose. I find it usually takes about 30 seconds or so.
