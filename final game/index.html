<h2>loading screen</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The idea/ story is kind of meta. It also has a lot of different types of play styles, with each world being a different base game mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
I used sprites, game states, and tilemapping
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I learned that switching to and from tilemapping TO regular format is not easy to do, at least if the state has been loaded before. I spent most of my time trying to figure it out to no avail. Since switching to and from the main screen was such a big part of the game, I spent a lot of time on that. I never found an answer. Because of this, it really just doesn't work.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made everything that you see from scratch. the sounds I got from freesound, although I never got around to adding them to the game.


<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I am not borrowing from any other project. World 1 will eventually be a platforming level, world 2 a bullethell, and world 3 a turn based fight. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You play as a stick figure who has to beat each worl to load the credits.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
3 diffferent play styles are in the game. There is rng in the 2nd world as to spawns, and rng determines the enemy's actions in world 3.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
platforming, collision, button choice turn based mechanics. It's a lot of things. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I suppose I would want them to have fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In the overworld and in world one, the player is able to move and jump as a platformer. In world 2, the player can move in any direction. In world 3, the player can choose from attacking, preparing for their next turn, and defending. Preparing will increase the damage you do if you attack, or the block better if you choose to defend.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I dont know tbh
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play as the man character of a hand drawn game. However, during loading the load bar stopped. It is now up you to go through the unloaded levels and gather items to help the loading bar finish, so that you can bewat the game.
Eventually you will be able to gather items to help you progress, and as you do so, more things will load. World 2 and 3 will be locked at the start, so you will have to start with world 1. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
a bored person.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
state changing and global variables aren't working correctly, so idk
</li>
