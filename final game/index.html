<h2>loading screen</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
The idea/ story is kind of meta. It also has a lot of different types of play styles, with each world being a different base game mechanic.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
At the moment, nothing much. I plan to make all the art myself, however what you see now is just a bunch of place holders.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
For one, I learned how tilemapping works. I also learned abot the Phaser physics engine, since I hadn't used gravity before this project
Easiest part was porting in world 2, as it's basically just the unfinished work my partner (jared) and I had done for HW3 as an addition to my HW1.Hardest part was jsut the tediousness of it. Making the placeholders, sizing them, and everything else. It honestly wasn't hard, just time consuming.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
I made most things from scratch. I used the same fail screen and continue button as i did in HW1, which was originally a skin for osu! the cats in world 2 i got from https://opengameart.org/content/cats-rework. Everything else was done in paint. 


<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I am not borrowing from any other project. World 1 will eventually be a platforming level, world 2 a bullethell, and world 3 a turn based fight. 
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
You play as a stick figure who has to beat each worl to load the credits.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
3 diffferent play styles are in the game. There is rng in the 2nd world as to spawns, and rng determines the enemy's actions in world 3.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
platforming, collision, button choice turn based mechanics. It's a lot of things. 
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I suppose I would want them to have fun.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In the overworld and in world one, the player is able to move and jump as a platformer. In world 2, the player can move in any direction. In world 3, the player can choose from attacking, preparing for their next turn, and defending. Preparing will increase the damage you do if you attack, or the block better if you choose to defend.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
slow and steady wins the race at the moment
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
You play as the man character of a hand drawn game. However, during loading the load bar stopped. It is now up you to go through the unloaded levels and gather items to help the loading bar finish, so that you can bewat the game.
Eventually you will be able to gather items to help you progress, and as you do so, more things will load. World 2 and 3 will be locked at the start, so you will have to start with world 1. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
a bored person.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
currently unfinished, so cannot say.
</li>
